## Description:

A Zuma-like 3D game. Basically the objective of the game is to eliminate all the balls rolling along a certain track. The player will sit in the middle of the tracks and face all the balls rolling around. The balls are of different colors. The player will hold all kinds of balls and try to use them to shoot the other balls. When balls of the same color collide, they all will disappear. When balls with diffrent colors collide, the ball that is shooted will be added to the track. This game has two levels. The maximum number of balls generated automatically is 100 for the first level, 200 for the second level. Once the player eliminates all those balls, the player survives the current level. If a ball reaches the destination without being eliminated, the player loses the game. After passing two levels, the player wins the game.  


## Advanced Techniques:

1. Collision Detection
2. Particle effects(When the balls are eliminated)  


### Keyboard controls:  
m: change the persective to a broader one so that the player can view the whole track  
left: move left  
right: move right  
up: move up  
down: move down  
space bar: shoot the ball
